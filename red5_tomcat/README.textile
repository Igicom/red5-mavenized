h2. Red5 Webapp Archetype - Mavenized

A "mavenized":http://maven.apache.org component of the "Red5 Flash Server":http://osflash.org/red5. 
This module contains all the base classes and resources required to run a standalone Apache Tomcat 6 server with Red5.

Presently not working. The Tomcat server will start, but work needs to be done so that the webapp dir can be configured.

h3. Building the mega jar

Maven will assemble all the dependency jars and create an executable jar using the follow command:

<pre>
	<code>
		 mvn assembly:assembly
	</code>
</pre>

This will produce the extremely verbose file name _target/red5-tomcat-jar-with-dependencies.jar_, which can
be executed via:

<pre>
	<code>
		 java -jar target/red5-tomcat-jar-with-dependencies.jar
	</code>
</pre>
